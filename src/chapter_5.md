# Pegasus API

*This chapter is **TBA** (to be announced).*

It will provide an API reference for building on Pegasus: endpoints, data formats, and how to read and write notebook data (protocols, molecules, images, tabular data) via the local API. Until then, see [Chapter 2: The ELN Open Standard](./chapter_2.md) for the data model and structure, and the Pegasus project documentation for current API details.
