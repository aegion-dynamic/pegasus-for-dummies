# Inspirations and Learning

Below is targeted research on ELNs (Electronic Lab Notebooks)—with creator archetypes and specific channels you can use for **hackathon inspiration, content framing, and demo formats**. The sections are grouped by *what hackathon participants can learn from them*, not just by popularity.

## 1. Core ELN tutorial creators (directly relevant)

These creators explicitly explain **how to use ELNs in real labs**, which is ideal for onboarding hackathoners.

### Benchling (official channel)

- **Content type:** Product tutorials, workflows, biotech R&D documentation practices
- **Why relevant:** Shows canonical workflows used in industry and academia
- **Topics covered:** Experiment tracking; protocol documentation; collaboration and sharing; inventory/sample management
- **Hackathon inspiration:** How a UI should guide experiment logging; structured metadata fields (experiment type, reagents, results); collaborative commenting and review flows

**Use for:** Challenge prompts like *"Build a minimal Benchling-style ELN for synthetic biology experiments."*

### Labstep (Revvity)

- **Content type:** ELN onboarding demos, lab digitization workflows
- **Why relevant:** Shows operational lab digitization, compliance, and audit trails
- **Topics covered:** Digital SOPs; compliance documentation; lab inventory + experiment linkage
- **Hackathon inspiration:** Traceability features (who edited what, when); regulatory compliance metadata (timestamps, signatures)

## 2. Academic / scientist workflow channels (indirect ELN inspiration)

These creators **don't teach ELNs directly but show how scientists document work**, which hackathoners can abstract into product features.

### NileRed

- **Domain:** Chemistry experiments
- **Why relevant:** Extremely structured documentation mindset, clear protocols
- **ELN inspiration:** Step-by-step protocol logging; safety notes and reagent tracking; experiment iterations and failures

**Hackathon prompt example:**

> Build an ELN that tracks chemical reaction parameters and outcomes like NileRed's experiments.

### The Thought Emporium

- **Domain:** DIY biotech & bioengineering
- **Why relevant:** Real-world biotech experiments outside institutional labs
- **ELN inspiration:** Open science documentation; experimental reproducibility; versioned experiment logs

**Useful for:** Citizen science / decentralized research ELN concepts.

### Dr. Becky (astrophysics) / other science vloggers

- **Domain:** Research workflow explanations
- **Why relevant:** Shows research lifecycle thinking—hypothesis → experiment → iteration → publication
- **ELN inspiration:** Linking hypotheses to experiments; narrative documentation (why an experiment was done)

## 3. Research workflow & productivity channels (high signal for hackathon UX)

These creators teach **how researchers organize knowledge**, which is exactly what ELNs digitize.

### Ali Abdaal / Thomas Frank (knowledge systems)

- **Domain:** Note-taking, research workflows
- **Why relevant:** Not lab-specific but excellent for UX inspiration
- **ELN inspiration:** Knowledge graphs; tagging systems; linking experiments to datasets and papers

### Obsidian / Notion scientific workflow creators

Search terms: "PhD workflow Notion", "Obsidian research workflow".

- **Why relevant:** Many PhDs use general-purpose tools as ELN substitutes
- **Hackathon insight:** ELNs should integrate with markdown, datasets, Git, and cloud storage

## 4. Open science & reproducibility advocates (strategic positioning)

These channels frame **why ELNs matter**, which is excellent for sponsor narrative.

### Open Science Foundation / reproducibility YouTubers

- **Domain:** Scientific reproducibility crisis
- **Why relevant:** ELNs solve reproducibility and auditability
- **ELN inspiration:** Experiment provenance tracking; dataset lineage; peer review annotations

**Hackathon challenge angle:**

> Build an ELN feature that ensures experiments are reproducible and peer-reviewable.

## 5. ELN-like tools tutorials (competitor / adjacent platforms)

These are **not ELNs but act like them** in practice.

### Jupyter notebook research channels

Search: "Research coding workflows Jupyter", "Lab notebook in Jupyter".

- **ELN inspiration:** Computational experiment logging; code + results + plots in a single timeline; versioned execution states

### Git for scientists tutorials

- Channels explaining Git in research; shows version control for experiments
- **Hackathon angle:** Git-like versioning for wet lab experiments; branching experiment protocols

## How to convert this into hackathon inspiration tracks

You can structure hackathon prompts around **creator-inspired workflows**:

### Track A: Digital lab documentation systems

Inspired by Benchling, Labstep.

- Build an ELN MVP for biology or chemistry labs
- Focus on structured protocols, metadata, collaboration

### Track B: Experimental knowledge graphs

Inspired by Obsidian / Notion workflows.

- Link hypotheses → experiments → datasets → results
- Build semantic tagging and search

### Track C: Open science & reproducibility

Inspired by open science creators.

- Build audit trails, provenance tracking, reproducibility reports

### Track D: Computational experiment notebooks

Inspired by Jupyter.

- Combine code, datasets, and results in a unified experiment timeline

## Key patterns to emphasize to hackathoners

From this research, ELNs are used for:

1. **Protocol documentation**
2. **Sample and reagent tracking**
3. **Experiment metadata and outcomes**
4. **Collaboration and review comments**
5. **Compliance and audit trails**
6. **Linking experiments to datasets and publications**
7. **Versioning experimental workflows**
