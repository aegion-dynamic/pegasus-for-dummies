# Start Here

This book is the **open source ecosystem contributor guide** for **Pegasus**, an open standard Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN) system. It sets context for ELNs and AI in life sciences, explains the ELN open standard, and supports hackathon participants and implementers building on Pegasus.

## Who this is for

- **Ecosystem contributors** — anyone extending or integrating with Pegasus
- **Hackathon and buildathon participants** — teams building AI modules, plugins, or tools that use ELN data
- **Implementers** — developers adopting the open standard or building compatible tools

## How to use this book

| Chapter | What you'll find |
|---------|------------------|
| **1. ELNs and AI in Life Sciences** | Context and hackathon ideas: what ELNs are, how they're used, and AI opportunities. |
| **2. The ELN Open Standard** | XML spec, primitives, API: root structure, metadata, content, tables, protocols (LabOP), knowledge graph, audit. |
| **3. ELNs at Work** | How life-science practitioners use ELNs day-to-day (planning, recording, data management, inventory, instruments, collaboration, compliance, knowledge management, integration, project management). |
| **4. Hackathon Guide** | Workflows, data types, AI extension ideas, and what buildathon judges look for. |
| **5. Pegasus API** | API reference for building on Pegasus (TBA). |
| **6. Inspirations and Learning** | Creators, tracks, and patterns from the ecosystem (ELN tutorials, research workflows, open science, Jupyter/Git). |
| **7. Idea Bank: BioProtocol and Decentralized Science** | In-depth coverage of open protocols, DeSci, and reproducibility; integrating with Pegasus. |
| **8. Idea Bank: LabOP** | In-depth coverage of the LabOP protocol standard and how it fits with the Pegasus ELN. |

### What buildathon judges care about

When evaluating projects, judges score five areas (substance over polish; evidence required):

- **Scientific utility (30%)** — Solves real researcher pain points (e.g. reproducibility, provenance).
- **Local-first (25%)** — Offline-capable; data stays on the researcher's machine; local models (e.g. Ollama).
- **Open standards (20%)** — Correct use of Pegasus data formats and local API (see [Chapter 2](./chapter_2.md) and [Pegasus API](./chapter_5.md)).
- **Extensibility (15%)** — Others can build on or extend the project; clear structure and docs.
- **Creativity (10%)** — Novel use of AI/ML with notebook data.

Weighted total (max 5.0): **4.2+** winning, **3.8–4.1** strong finalist, **&lt;3.0** participation. Details are in the [Hackathon Guide](./chapter_4.md#evaluation-at-a-glance).

## I want to...

- **Understand ELNs and get hackathon ideas** → Start with [Chapter 1](./chapter_1.md).
- **Implement the standard or build on the API** → Go to [Chapter 2](./chapter_2.md).
- **Prepare for the hackathon** → Read [Chapters 3–4](./chapter_3.md) (ELNs at Work, Hackathon Guide) and the evaluation notes there; then [Chapters 6–8](./chapter_6.md) (Inspirations, Idea Banks).
- **Explore idea banks** → See [Chapter 7](./chapter_7.md) (BioProtocol / DeSci) and [Chapter 8](./chapter_8.md) (LabOP).
